#We're going to build a ToDo App! 

The world desperately needs a way to make ToDo lists on the web.
How has no one thought of this before?

Our crack team of monkeys sat down at their keyboards and wrote stories until we found a few that worked. 
They kept writing Hamlet for some reason.
```
To do, or not to do, that is the question.
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Errors and Omissions of outrageous Forgetfullness,
Or to take Arms against the Sea of responsibilities,
And by writing them down remember them: to do, to record
No more; and by to record, to say we end
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
That Forgetting is heir to?  'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To do, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of done, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off all our tasks,
Must give us pause.
```
If only we had a BA and not some silly Developer writing these.

#Our Awesome Stories
```
In order to know what web site I am on
As a user
I want to see the name of the application displayed as a header
```

```
In order to see my ToDos
As a user
I want to see a list of tasks that need to be done
```

```
In order to mark my ToDos complete
As a user
I want a way to indicate they are done
```

```
In order to add more ToDos to my list
As a user
I want a simple form that will add a ToDo to my list
```

```
In order to remove ToDos I no longer want to see or that I added by mistake
As a user
I want a method of deleting a single ToDo
```
