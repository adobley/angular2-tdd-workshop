# Introduction

This project is built on top of [angular-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed) for all the goodness it provides.

This repo will be used as the starting point for a TDD workshop with Angular 2. I'll spend more time making a pretty README when I can prove out the concept.

# Building

Run ```npm install```

# Testing

Run ```npm test```
